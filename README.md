A simple Java finance manager for Android.
The graphics part is all writed in XML, with the google MaterialDesign library.
All the software is well documented!

NOTE:
This is only the src directory, for use this simply create a new project on Android studio,
cut and paste this directory and ready to go (if doesn't work, is probably a problem with Gradle).
